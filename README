burnaddress takes a base 58 input string and creates a valid, but **unspendable**,
cryptocurrency address out of it.

This version is customized to create Ethercoin addresses that have 0x21 as
the version byte and start with 'EJ'. The 'J' is necessary because not all
addresses that start with 'E' have 0x21 as the first byte.

This can be used in three ways:

1. Run gui.py for a Tkinter GUI. Enter your string in the Vanity field and press enter.
You can also change the version number, payload, or checksum and get the
base 58 result.

2. Run burnaddress.py in a console. It will ask for a string and print the
resulting burn address, along with a warning.

3. import burnaddress from another python script.
burnaddress.base58_to_base58check will take a string and output a burn address.

**WARNING: Addresses created with this have no associated private keys and
cannot be spent from! Do not send any coins to any of them unless you intend
to burn them!**
