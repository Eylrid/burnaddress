burnaddress takes a base 58 input string and creates a valid, but **unspendable**,
Bitcoin address out of it.

Based on https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_background_of_Bitcoin_addresses
and https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding and inspired by
1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE.

**WARNING: Addresses created with this have no associated private keys and
cannot be spent from! Do not send any bitcoin to any of them unless you intend
to burn it!**
